        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Slab-Stash! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and Slab-Stash, a Florida-based entity ("Slab-Stash," "we," "us," or "our"), governing your access to and use of the Slab-Stash website, located at www.slab-stash.com ("Website"), and your purchase of any products offered through the Website ("Products"). By accessing, browsing, or purchasing from the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are expressly prohibited from accessing or using the Website or purchasing Products.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and possess the legal capacity to enter into this agreement. Slab-Stash does not knowingly permit individuals under 18 years of age to use the Website or purchase Products. If you are under 18, you must immediately cease use of the Website.</p>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <h3>Ordering and Payment Obligations</h3>
        <p>When placing an order through the Website, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted during the checkout process, including but not limited to your full legal name, billing address, shipping address, email address, and payment details. You further agree to promptly update this information if it changes prior to shipment to ensure timely and accurate delivery. All payments must be made in full at the time of purchase using an accepted payment method as indicated on the Website, including all applicable sales taxes, shipping fees, and any additional charges disclosed prior to finalizing your order. Slab-Stash reserves the absolute right, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to refuse, suspend, or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to suspected fraud, payment disputes, product unavailability, inaccuracies in pricing or product descriptions, or any other circumstances deemed appropriate by Slab-Stash. In the event of such cancellation, you will be notified via the email address provided at checkout, and any payment received will be refunded to the original payment method within a commercially reasonable timeframe, typically within 7-14 business days, subject to banking processing times beyond our control.</p>

        <h3>Product Information, Pricing, and Availability</h3>
        <p>Slab-Stash endeavors to provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding Products, including descriptions, images, pricing, and availability, as displayed on the Website. Notwithstanding these efforts, Slab-Stash does not guarantee or warrant that such information is free from errors, omissions, or inaccuracies, whether typographical, technical, or otherwise. All Product descriptions are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute a warranty or representation of the Product’s condition, quality, or suitability for any particular purpose. Prices are subject to change at any time without prior notice, and such changes will not affect orders already confirmed by Slab-Stash via email confirmation. In the event of a pricing error (e.g., a Product listed at an incorrect price due to a clerical or system error), Slab-Stash reserves the right to cancel any affected orders and issue a full refund of any payments made, without further liability or obligation to you. Products are offered subject to availability, and Slab-Stash reserves the right to limit quantities or discontinue any Product at any time without prior notice. All prices are quoted and payable in United States dollars (USD) unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>

        <h3>Shipping and Delivery Terms</h3>
        <p>Slab-Stash offers standard shipping with a flat fee for all orders shipped within the United States. Orders are typically processed and shipped within 1-2 business days after purchase confirmation, and you will receive a tracking number via email to monitor your shipment’s progress. Delivery is estimated to take 2-4 business days from the date of shipment, depending on your location, but this is an estimate only. Actual delivery times may vary due to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to carrier performance, weather conditions, natural disasters, governmental restrictions, or unforeseen logistical challenges. Shipping is limited to addresses within the United States, and Slab-Stash does not offer international shipping at this time. Slab-Stash shall not be liable for any delays, losses, or damages incurred during shipping. Risk of loss and title to the Products pass to you upon delivery of the Products to the designated carrier at our fulfillment facility. You are solely responsible for inspecting shipments upon receipt and filing any claims for lost, damaged, or incomplete deliveries directly with the carrier. Slab-Stash will provide reasonable assistance, such as tracking information, upon request, but disclaims any obligation to replace or refund Products lost or damaged in transit.</p>

        <h3>No Returns Policy; Future Buyback Program</h3>
        <p>All purchases of Products from Slab-Stash are final and non-returnable. Due to the unique nature of the Products, once a package is opened, it cannot be returned under any circumstances, including but not limited to dissatisfaction with the contents, perceived value, or condition upon receipt. Slab-Stash does not offer refunds, exchanges, or replacements for opened Products, and you acknowledge that your purchase constitutes acceptance of this no-returns policy. In the event of a shipping error (e.g., receipt of an incorrect Product due to Slab-Stash’s mistake), you must notify us within 48 hours of delivery at <a href="mailto:customersupport@slab-stash.com">customersupport@slab-stash.com</a> with photographic evidence and order details, and Slab-Stash will, at its sole discretion, determine whether to provide a replacement, subject to availability, or issue a refund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Slab-Stash is developing a "buyback" program for certain qualifying major hits, to be implemented at a future date. This program will allow eligible customers to sell back specific items to Slab-Stash under separate terms and conditions, which will be detailed and published on the Website when the program becomes available. Participation in the buyback program is not guaranteed and will be subject to Slab-Stash’s discretion and applicable eligibility criteria.</p>
