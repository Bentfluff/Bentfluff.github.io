        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Slab Stash</span>, your friendly little corner for affordable coin collecting!</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Slab Stash began with a simple thought: coin collecting should be easy on the wallet and big on fun. We’re passionate about slabbed coins—those neatly graded gems—and love offering them at prices that don’t require a treasure map to afford. It’s just us, bringing you coins we’d happily keep ourselves.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>We sell a handpicked stash of slabbed coins at an affordable price point, straight from us to you. No complications, just quality coins that fit your budget and your collection. We’re also working on a buyback program (details TBD)—because we think collecting should be a two-way street.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To make coin collecting simple, affordable, and enjoyable, creating a warm spot for folks who share our love for slabbed coins.</p>
